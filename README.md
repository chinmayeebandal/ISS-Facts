# ISS-Facts

This project tracks the position of the International Space Station(ISS), gives the latitude and the longitude, tells how many
people are currently there in the space, and also tells how many passes the ISS made over a location when the user provides 
the geographic coordinates.
I have built this project upon the idea of our CS course Professor, Jesse Hartloff (https://github.com/hartloff).
This is my first project and I was wondering how I should start off when I came upon the "ISS Locator" idea introduced in
the class and thought I'll start off by building on it.
